/// The `ShiftConfigurator` is capable of creating and configuring a replicant for a `Shift` animation, but is not capable of performing the animation itself.
/// This can be useful when the `Shift` being performed is stationary, or would otherwise not generate a Core Animation object. Instead of relying on the automatic completion
/// of the animation, this configured replicant will remain stationary until manually cleaned up.
